# SlidingImages-Html-CSS
Tried to make the sliding images from  https://camillemormal.com/ personal portfolio website

Camille Mormal's website is one of a kind, and features a clean and minimalist design, with a simple color scheme of black and white. The homepage features a large banner with the website's name and a brief description of the artist's work. The site is divided into several sections, including "Graphic Design," "Illustration," "Fine Arts," and "Contact."

Each section displays a gallery of the artist's work with images and captions describing the pieces. I tried to recreate the sliding images but unfortunately was unable to achieve the level of smoothness Camille's website offered.
